## Documentation

Latest documentation can be found at [Read the Docs](https://croupier.readthedocs.io)

> **TIP:** Example blueprints can be found at the [Croupier resources repository](https://github.com/ari-apc-lab/croupier-resources).

## Install and Usage

The plugin is installed as any other plugin. Check [Cloudify Docs](http://docs.getcloudify.org/4.5.5/intro/what-is-cloudify) for general information about how to install and use Cloudify, and [this section](http://docs.getcloudify.org/4.1.0/plugins/using-plugins) for concrete information about using plugins.

Additionally, Croupier provides [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images at [croupier-cli](https://github.com/ari-apc-lab/croupier-cli) to remotely install and operate with the orchestrator. An already built docker image is also available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/croupier/dashboard/).

## Test

To run the tests Cloudify CLI has to be installed locally. Example blueprints can be found at _tests/blueprint_ folder and have the `simulate` option active by default. Blueprint to be tested can be changed at _workflows_tests.py_ in the _tests_ folder.

To run the tests against a real HPC / Monitor system, copy the file _blueprint-inputs.yaml_ to _local-blueprint-inputs.yaml_ and edit with your credentials. Then edit the blueprint commenting the simulate option, and other parameters as you wish (e.g change the name ft2_node for your own hpc name). To use the openstack integration, your private key must be put in the folder _inputs/keys_.

> **NOTE:** _tox_ needs to be installed: `pip install tox`

To run the tests, run tox on the root folder

```shell
tox -e flake8,py27
```
