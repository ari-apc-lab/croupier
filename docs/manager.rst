============
Installation
============

Croupier, as a Cloudify plugin, must to be run inside the Cloudify Server, a.k.a Cloudify Manager. This section describes how to install Cloudify Manager, with the Croupier plugin.

Cloudify Manager
================

Docker
------

Cloudify provides a docker image of the manager. It cannot be configured so, among other things, it is not secure (user admin/admin).

.. code:: bash

  sudo docker run --name cfy_manager -d --restart unless-stopped \
    -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
    --tmpfs /run \
    --tmpfs /run/lock \
    --security-opt seccomp:unconfined \
    --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
    --network host \
    cloudifyplatform/community:19.01.24

  docker run --name cfy_manager -d --restart unless-stopped \
    -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro \
    --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /run/lock \
    --security-opt seccomp:unconfined \
    --cap-add SYS_ADMIN \
    -p 80:80 \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    cloudifyplatform/community-cloudify-manager-aio


OpenStack plugin (Optional)

.. code:: bash

  cfy plugins upload \
    -y http://www.getcloudify.org/spec/openstack-plugin/2.14.7/plugin.yaml \
    http://repository.cloudifysource.org/cloudify/wagons/cloudify-openstack-plugin/2.14.7/cloudify_openstack_plugin-2.14.7-py27-none-linux_x86_64-centos-Core.wgn


Requirements
------------

Cloudify Manager is supported for installation on a 64-bit host with RHEL/CentOS 7.4.

+---------+---------+-------------+
|         | Minimum | Recommended |
+=========+=========+=============+
| vCPUs   | 2       | 8           |
+---------+---------+-------------+
| RAM     | 4GB     | 16GB        |
+---------+---------+-------------+
| Storage | 5GB     | 64GB        |
+---------+---------+-------------+

The minimum requirements are enough for small deployments that only manage a few compute instances. Managers that manage more deployments or large deployments need at least the recommended resources.

Check `Cloudify docs <https://docs.cloudify.co/4.5.5/install_maintain/installation/prerequisites/>`__ for full prerequisites details.
